{As a first time user}

  Arrive at the landing page greeted by a rotating list of scorecards and an intuitive UI. I will be able to move to separate pages to view subsets of schools by the location or by academic factors.

  On the landing page or search page I will be greeted by smaller scorecards with an image of the school (stock photo atm), the name and location of the school, the website and a few key facts about the school.

  When a card is clicked on it will open a modal with much more detail about the given school with tabulated data for an overview, the academics, student life and financial information.

  Searching will be available from the nav bar on all page or from the search bar in the given search pages. Searches can be a specific school name or a location that will return the schools in that area (region, state, city)
