# **College Scorecard**
### **Description**
College Scorecard is an app that returns information about colleges and universities in the United States based on their location. Each card has general information about the school as well as information about the academics, student body, and costs. The app leverages data provided by the from the Department of Education [College Scorecard](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/) API.
### **Motivation**
This was a first attempt at working with an API and filtering the resulting data into an accessable format. 
### **How To Use**
The application can be accessed through Github Pages [here](https://dscrane.github.io/CollegeScorecard/) or by cloning the repo and running it on your local machine.
